However, despite the advancements there appears to be very little research on chatbot implementation specific to small businesses..

Despite the numerous benefits of conversational AI, it’s crucial to acknowledge situations where they may not be the best solution.
Highly sensitive or complex customer issues may require human intervention.
Also very small businesses with low query volumes may not reap substantial benefits from conversational AI chatbots.
However lead generating chatbots can help small businesses grow..
A balance between human and automated customer service is beneficial, because there are instances where human interaction adds value to the customer experience.
